run "make"

*The order matters
run "./hw5GrandmaHome"
run "./hw5Forest"
run "./hw5Home"

The program will create 1 server (GrandmaHome), 1 client (Home), and 1 server/client (Forest).
It's important to run the programs in the given order because the server needs to set up before
any data is sent from the client to server.

Once ./hw5Home is ran, Little Red Riding Hood and the objects associated with her will be moved
to Forest then to GrandmaHome.
